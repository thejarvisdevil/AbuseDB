# AbuseDB for Geode
<cg>This Geode mod serves to implement AbuseDB's additional moderation system into Geometry Dash.</c>

## What is AbuseDB?
<cy>AbuseDB is a project created by jarvisdevil that serves as an alternative form of in-game moderation.</c>  
How it works is when you go on a level or a profile that has been flagged by our moderators as inappropriate content,  
it will warn you before it lets you do anything else.

## Frequently Asked Questions
- Why am I banned from flagging?
We have implemented a new system for ignoring bad reports so everyone was unbanned.  
This happens if you try to flag an account in-game.  
<cr>We do not handle account reports anymore and only jarvisdevil can flag accounts...</c>  
<cb>You can contact @jarvisdevlin on Discord (fastest response) or @jarvisdevil in-game if you have found either a bot or account that hosts many inappropriate levels.</c>  
- Do reports get sent to actual Geometry Dash moderators?
