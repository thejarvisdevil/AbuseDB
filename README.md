# AbuseDB for Geode

This Geode mod serves to implement AbuseDB's additional moderation system into Geometry Dash, making the community much more safer.

## What is AbuseDB
AbuseDB is a project created by jarvisdevil that serves as an alternative form of in-game moderation.  
We know it's difficult to report levels and accounts if you don't have Discord (maybe because of a country ban or you're under 13).  

Sometimes, when you send a DM to an Elder Moderator, it often gets ignored or you just have way too much stuff to report and you don't feel like the type of person to shred someone's time. There isn't really that much of a better way to report stuff from Geometry Dash and that sucks.  

So we have our own team of moderators that goes through your in-game content reports, and if we think it's bad, then the content will get flagged and will show to everyone that a level might be inappropriate (this saves other peoples eyes from having to see such a level if it's flagged), or an account has been involved in some pretty bad stuff (such as repeated harassment or being a bot account).  

All flagged content shows up on [our website](https://jarvisdevil.com/abuse/flags.php). You can also be a hero by actually reporting specific content to Elder Moderators.  

AbuseDB was made to save a few seconds of Elder Moderators' time since they are always busy. This mod combats the time issues and in turn helps make the game more safer.

## Features
- **Level Reporting**: Report levels directly to AbuseDB moderators in-game for flagging.
- **Account Reporting**: Report accounts directly to AbuseDB moderators in-game for flagging.
- **Flag Alerts**: Shows you an alert if you are trying to access content flagged by AbuseDB, You can hide alerts for specific content so you don't get annoyed.

## Example Use Cases
- **Level Request Streamer?**: If you do level request streams on YouTube or Twitch, people may send NSFW levels to try to get you banned off the platform. With AbuseDB, if someone else reports a level and gets flagged (we are fast on these cases) then you will know before playing the level on stream that you might be playing a level that has NSFW content inside it.
- **Bot or Not?**: If you receive a strange message in Geometry Dash or someone you met has highly suspicious behavior, you can check their profile. The moment you click on someone's profile, an alert might pop up about the account if it's flagged. Since we also flag bot/spam accounts, you will know it might be a bot. If you did find a bot and it's not flagged, report it through the in-game account reporting system.
- **Daily Chat**: omg just start reporting everyone there :sob:
