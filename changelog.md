# v1.3.0
- discord text on popups are fixed so they dont go offscreen (huge thanks to my 6 inch hdmi display!)
- mods can flag in-game now!
- commonly used special characters are now allowed in text fields
- in the abusedb menu, i swapped mod list for a link to my youtube channel. kids kept annoying abusedb mods so i made it harder for them to be message spammed.
